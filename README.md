Analysis of Seattle AirBnB reservation prices

## Analysis Overview
Finding an accomodation is the most typical problem to be solved, when travelling to other city or country. And one of the most important things in choosing an accomodation is the reservation price. What are the main factors, which affect the reservation prices? Does time of the year influence prices and what are the busiest times of the year to visit particular city? How can we save money on the reservation?
Fortunately, we can try to answer these questions by analysing publicly accessible __[AirBnB](https://www.airbnb.com)__ data, available on __[Inside AirBnB](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html)__ and on __[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle)__.
